// Scheduled promotion sweep — the issue #4 "Notify" requirement. A weekly
// background pass posts the promotion-eligible candidate list for the
// configured position scopes to a configured channel, so S1 gets told
// rather than having to remember to ask.
//
// Pattern mirrors the Star Citizen joiner-report scheduler
// (star_citizen_joiners.go): sleep-until-fire loop, per-fire panic recovery
// (a panic in one sweep must not kill the loop — see issue #119 rationale
// there), a narrow session interface for testability, and a `now` seam.
//
// The target channel, swept scope, and the kill switch are all compile-time
// constants, not environment variables — tenant-specific 7Cav config the bot
// keeps in code, matching the joiner report (hardcoded Discord IDs) and
// /warden (role name). Environment variables here are reserved for secrets and
// deployment identity. Disabling the sweep or moving its channel is a code
// change and redeploy, the same as the joiner report.
