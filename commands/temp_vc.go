// Temporary voice channels (issue #100, first slice of the MEE6 migration).
//
// A member joining any configured hub voice channel gets a personal voice
// channel spawned under that hub's category and is moved into it. Each hub
// carries its own defaults (user limit, bitrate, empty-channel grace) that are
// stamped on the channels it spawns, so a "Squad" hub and a "Briefing" hub can
// behave differently. The creator receives a per-channel permission overwrite
// (ManageChannels + MoveMembers) so they can rename the channel, set a user
// limit, and move or disconnect occupants, matching MEE6's owner model. The
// overwrite itself is the only durable ownership marker; nothing is persisted.
//
// Cleanup is event-driven: when a temp channel empties, a grace timer starts
// (its hub's grace, default 15s, covering quick disconnect/reconnects); if
// nobody returns before it fires, the channel is deleted. Orphans left by a
// bot restart are reaped by the GUILD_CREATE sweep. A hub's category is the
// marker for "temp", so any empty channel under any hub category (except the
// hubs themselves) is deleted on every connect/resume, and non-empty survivors
// are adopted with no recorded owner (their overwrite keeps working; the bot
// just no longer knows who made them).
//
// This is the codebase's first gateway-event feature. GuildVoiceStates is an
// unprivileged intent already covered by IntentsAllWithoutPrivileged in
// main.go, so no identify or Developer Portal change is needed.
